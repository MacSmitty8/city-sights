# About
This project is about seeing details about different tourist spots that one can go to. It's a basic take on a tourism website.

# Built with Create React App and SCSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App], but it also utilizes SCSS.

# Challenges
At one point in the project, whenever you clicked on the arrow to hide/show the info of a tour, it'd affect all boxes instead of one. As of right now, I'm still trying to fix this error.

Another thing I'd say is that the project itself is reliant on the info you'd find the SightTourData.js file. I'm sure there's ways to add more, but that'll be a future issue to tackle.
